## Convert to AspectJ Project ##

To run AspectJ in Eclipse you need downloading[ AJDT (AspectJ Development Tools)](http://www.eclipse.org/ajdt/downloads/) for Eclipse.  

After downloading and installing the plugin you will need to convert your project to an AspectJ project.  To do so, right click your project in the project explorer and under "Configure" select "Convert to AspectJ Project".  This doesn't stop it from being a Maven project, it simply adds AspectJ support to your project.  

Note: You can remove AspectJ support from your project by right clicking it in the project explorer, selecting "AspectJ Tools" and selecting "Remove AspectJ Capability".
